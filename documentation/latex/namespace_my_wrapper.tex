Library.

This include file contains the definitions of the \hyperlink{class_c_object}{C\-Object} class which contains a static library of methods. Attributes.

This include file contains the definitions of the \hyperlink{class_c_attribute}{C\-Attribute} class which can be used to manage the object's attributes. Offsets.

This include file contains all default offset definitions. Common ancestor.

This class represents the ancestor of most entity mapped classes, it maps objects to an array by deriving from \hyperlink{}{Array\-Object} and it defines a couple of general purpose utility static methods.

This class implements the following interfaces\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Offsets}\-: In this class there cannot be an offset with a {\itshape N\-U\-L\-L} value, the offset itself should be \hyperlink{}{deleted} in that case. Because of this we also override the inherited behaviour by suppressing notices and warnings when \hyperlink{}{getting} non-\/existant offsets. 
\item {\itshape String formatting}\-: We provide a generalised static method to \hyperlink{}{format} strings which accepts a bitfield parameter that indicates which operation to perform, such as \hyperlink{}{U\-T\-F8} encode, \hyperlink{}{left} and \hyperlink{}{right} trim, \hyperlink{}{N\-U\-L\-L} handling, \hyperlink{}{case} insensitive conversion, \hyperlink{}{U\-R\-L}, \hyperlink{}{H\-T\-M\-L} and \hyperlink{}{H\-E\-X} encoding and \hyperlink{}{hashing}. 
\item {\itshape Time formatting}\-: We provide a generalised static \hyperlink{}{method} to display duration strings.

Exceptions.

This include file contains the exception class definitions. Tokens.

This include file contains all token definitions. Attribute class.

This class is a static methods repository which is used to manage \hyperlink{class_c_array_object}{C\-Array\-Object} derived classe's attributes.

The class is a collection of static methods which represent member accessor methods for objects that store their properties as array elements. These methods will handle insertion, extraction and deletion of attributes in either arrays or Array\-Object instances, these methods will then be used by \hyperlink{class_c_array_object}{C\-Array\-Object} derived classes as the base for their member accessor methods.

The class features the following methods\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{Manage\-Offset}}\-: Manage a scalar offset. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{Manage\-Array\-Offset}}\-: Manage elements of an array offset. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{Manage\-Typed\-Offset}}\-: Manage elements of an array offset by category or type. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{Manage\-Typed\-Array\-Offset}}\-: Manage elements of an array offset by category or type and data element value.

This include file contains the address class definitions. Contact.

This class overloads its \hyperlink{class_c_entity}{ancestor} to implement a contact entity.

Contacts are entities that need to be tracked by \hyperlink{}{mail}, \hyperlink{}{telephone} or \hyperlink{}{e-\/mail}.

The class features the following properties\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-O\-F\-F\-S\-E\-T\-\_\-\-M\-A\-I\-L}}\-: The contact \hyperlink{}{mailing} address list. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-O\-F\-F\-S\-E\-T\-\_\-\-P\-H\-O\-N\-E}}\-: The contact \hyperlink{}{telephone} list. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

These three properties are managed as an array of elements discriminated by the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-K\-I\-N\-D} offset, no two elements may share the same \hyperlink{}{kind}.

The object inherits the \hyperlink{}{inited} \hyperlink{}{status}, it is the responsibility of concrete classes to implement this feature.

Ancestor.

This include file contains the parent class definitions. Grid container.

This include file contains the file grid class definitions. Dataset object.

Besides the inherited properties. datasets have the following attributes\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{Title}}\-: The dataset \hyperlink{}{title} represents the dataset name or identifier provided by the dataset creator, this attribute is used in the object's \hyperlink{}{identifier}. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{User}}\-: The dataset \hyperlink{}{user} represents the \hyperlink{}{identifier} of the \hyperlink{class_c_user}{user} that created the dataset, this attribute is used in the object's \hyperlink{}{identifier}. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{Name}}\-: The dataset \hyperlink{}{name} represents the name or label by which the dataset is referred to. Unlike the \hyperlink{}{title} which has an identification purpose, this attribute has a documentation purpose and can be expressed in several languages. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{Description}}\-: The dataset \hyperlink{}{description} represents a description or definition of the dataset, it can be expressed in several languages. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

By default, the unique \hyperlink{}{identifier} of the object is the combination of the \hyperlink{}{user} \hyperlink{}{identifier} and the dataset \hyperlink{}{title}.

Objects of this class require at least the \hyperlink{}{user} and \hyperlink{}{title} offsets set to have an \hyperlink{}{initialised} \hyperlink{}{status}.

Ancestor.

This include file contains the parent class definitions. Dataset file.

This class implements a dataset file, it wraps the \hyperlink{class_c_array_object}{parent} class around a structure that records a dataset file's attributes.

In general instances of this class will be embedded in a \hyperlink{class_c_dataset}{dataset} objects to add lists of file references, the current class does not feature any persistence functions, it only concentrates in managing a file reference as a set of properties\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{File}}\-: This \hyperlink{}{property} defines a file, it represents the Grid\-F\-S record identifier for the file. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{Referenced}}\-: This \hyperlink{}{property} holds the list of file \hyperlink{}{references}, this attribute all files that were generated taking the current file as a model. For instance, this list would contain all C\-S\-V files generated from all the workbooks of an Excel file. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{Status}}\-: This \hyperlink{}{property} holds the list of states in which the current file is. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{Kind}}\-: This \hyperlink{}{property} holds the list of kinds or types assigned to the file. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{Columns}}\-: This \hyperlink{}{property} holds the list of column headers and associated metadata structured as follows\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-T\-A\-G}}\-: The \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_tag}{tag} associated with the data in the current column. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{Title}}\-: The original header \hyperlink{}{title} provided in the file and used for the annotation. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

You should always instantiate this class from the \hyperlink{class_c_dataset}{dataset} by using its \hyperlink{}{static} method rather than instantiating the class on its own, this is because this way it is guaranteed that the record points to an existing file.

This include file contains all local definitions to this class. Data wrapper.

This class overloads its \hyperlink{class_c_wrapper}{ancestor} to implement a web service that wraps a data store, it represents a framework for building concrete data store web-\/service wrappers.

The class introduces a series of new operations and filter options that must be implemented in derived classes which implement a specific data store.

These new functionalities require a new set of parameters\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Data store parameters}\-: In order to refer to a specific data store we need two parameters\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-D\-A\-T\-A\-B\-A\-S\-E}}\-: {\itshape Database}, this parameter should indicate the database or equivalent concept where the data should be stored or retrieved. This parameter can be compared to the database part of an S\-Q\-L table reference ({\itshape D\-A\-T\-A\-B\-A\-S\-E}.T\-A\-B\-L\-E). 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-C\-O\-N\-T\-A\-I\-N\-E\-R}}\-: {\itshape Container}, this parameter should indicate which container within the \hyperlink{}{database} should be used to store or retrieve the data. This parameter can be compared to the table part of an S\-Q\-L table reference (D\-A\-T\-A\-B\-A\-S\-E.{\itshape T\-A\-B\-L\-E}). 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Paging parameters}\-: Query results may possibly return large amounts of data, this means that a paging mechanism should be set in place\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-P\-A\-G\-E\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-R\-T}}\-: {\itshape Page start}, this parameter indicates the starting page or record. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-P\-A\-G\-E\-\_\-\-L\-I\-M\-I\-T}}\-: {\itshape Page count}, this parameter indicates the maximum number of pages or records that the operation should return. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Data parameters}\-: A query is formed by a series of sections, each of which is provided with the following parameters\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-D\-A\-T\-A\-\_\-\-Q\-U\-E\-R\-Y}}\-: {\itshape Query}, this parameter is used when retrieving data, it represents the filter or selection query; it must be expressed as one of the query \hyperlink{class_c_query}{class} siblings. This parameter can be compared to the {\itshape W\-H\-E\-R\-E} part of an S\-Q\-L query. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-D\-A\-T\-A\-\_\-\-F\-I\-E\-L\-D}}\-: {\itshape Fields}, this parameter indicates which elements of the selected objects we want returned. This parameter can be compared to the {\itshape S\-E\-L\-E\-C\-T} part of an S\-Q\-L query. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-D\-A\-T\-A\-\_\-\-S\-O\-R\-T}}\-: {\itshape Sort fields}, this parameter indicates the sort order, the list of data elements by which the result is to be sorted. This parameter can be compared to the \hyperlink{}{field} parameter or to the {\itshape O\-R\-D\-E\-R B\-Y} part of an S\-Q\-L query. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-D\-A\-T\-A\-\_\-\-O\-B\-J\-E\-C\-T}}\-: {\itshape Object data}, this parameter represents the data to be stored in the database, the type should ideally be abstracted from the data store engine. This parameter can be compared to the {\itshape V\-A\-L\-U\-E\-S} or {\itshape S\-E\-T} part of an S\-Q\-L query. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-D\-A\-T\-A\-\_\-\-O\-P\-T\-I\-O\-N\-S}}\-: {\itshape Options}, this parameter represents the options governing data store and retrieve operations. In general it will cover the options when storing data and the actual implementation is the responsibility of derived classes\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-T\-\_\-\-S\-A\-F\-E}}\-: Safe commit option, this is relevant only when committing data. If this option is {\itshape O\-F\-F}, it means we want to perform an asynchronous operation\-: the store operation will occur in the background and the program execution will not wait for it to finish; this also means that the client is responsible for checking whether the operation completed. If the option is {\itshape O\-N}, the operation is synchronous, which means that the program will wait for the store operation to complete. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-T\-\_\-\-F\-S\-Y\-N\-C}}\-: File sync option, this tag is relevant only when committing data. If the option is {\itshape O\-N}, it means that the store operation will wait until the data is actually written to disk; which may not necessarily be the case even if the \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-T\-\_\-\-S\-A\-F\-E} option was on. When this option is set, it is implied that the \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-T\-\_\-\-S\-A\-F\-E} option is also on. If the option is {\itshape O\-F\-F}, it means that the data will be synched to disk only when the buffer is flushed. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-T\-\_\-\-T\-I\-M\-E\-O\-U\-T}}\-: Operation timeout, it represents the time in milliseconds beyond which the client will stop waiting for a response and expect a time out status. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-T\-\_\-\-S\-I\-N\-G\-L\-E}}\-: First element, this option is used by the \hyperlink{}{delete} operation\-: if {\itshape O\-N}, only the first object satisfying the \hyperlink{}{query} will be deleted; if {\itshape O\-F\-F} all selected elements will be deleted. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-T\-\_\-\-S\-I\-N\-G\-L\-E}}\-: First element, this option 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

The new operations declared in this class are\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-\_\-\-C\-O\-U\-N\-T}}\-: This operation requests a count, which is an integer indicating the total number of elements satisfying the provided \hyperlink{}{query}. This number is not to be confused with the page element \hyperlink{}{count} described further. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-\_\-\-M\-A\-T\-C\-H}}\-: This operation is equivalent to a read query, except that it will try to match one \hyperlink{}{query} clause at the time and will return a result on the first match. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-\_\-\-G\-E\-T}}\-: This operation is equivalent to a read query, it requests a list of objects satisfying the provided \hyperlink{}{query}. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-\_\-\-S\-E\-T}}\-: This operation is equivalent to an insert for new objects or an update for existing objects, the operation will replace the object in the data store with the one provided in the \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-D\-A\-T\-A\-\_\-\-O\-B\-J\-E\-C\-T} parameter. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-\_\-\-U\-P\-D\-A\-T\-E}}\-: This operation is equivalent to an update operation, this implies that the object must already exist in the data store and that the operation will replace the object in the data store with the one provided in the \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-D\-A\-T\-A\-\_\-\-O\-B\-J\-E\-C\-T} parameter. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-\_\-\-I\-N\-S\-E\-R\-T}}\-: This operation is equivalent to an insert operation, this implies that the object must not already exist in the data store. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-\_\-\-B\-A\-T\-C\-H\-\_\-\-I\-N\-S\-E\-R\-T}}\-: This operation is equivalent to the \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-\_\-\-I\-N\-S\-E\-R\-T} operation, except that we provide here a list of objects to be inserted. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-\_\-\-M\-O\-D\-I\-F\-Y}}\-: This operation indicates that we want to modify the contents of an existing object and that the \hyperlink{}{provided} data represents only the changed elements. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-\_\-\-D\-E\-L}}\-: This operation indicates that we want to delete the elements matching the provided \hyperlink{}{query}\-: the first one only, if the provided \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-T\-\_\-\-S\-I\-N\-G\-L\-E} option is on, or all if off or omitted. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

The added functionality implies that a series of additional sections will be returned in the response\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-D\-A\-T\-A\-\_\-\-P\-A\-G\-I\-N\-G}}\-: Paging section, this section will return the paging information of the current operation, besides the provided \hyperlink{}{start} and \hyperlink{}{limit} parameters, it will also feature\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-P\-A\-G\-E\-\_\-\-C\-O\-U\-N\-T}}\-: This element will hold the actual number of returned objects, this number will be either equal or smaller than the provided \hyperlink{}{limit} parameter. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

This include file contains the parent class definitions. Entity.

An entity can be an individual, and organisation or a legal entity that exists as a unit, rather than being embedded in another object.

In this class we add to the \hyperlink{class_c_coded_unit_object}{parent} the following properties\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-A\-M\-E}}\-: This offset represents the entity name, the class features a member accessor \hyperlink{}{method} to manage this property. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-O\-F\-F\-S\-E\-T\-\_\-\-E\-M\-A\-I\-L}}\-: This offset represents the entity e-\/mail address, it is a scalar property and the class features a member accessor \hyperlink{}{method} to manage it. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

The class also features a static \hyperlink{}{method} that returns the default container name for objects of this type.

Objects derived from this class will have their \hyperlink{}{encoded} \hyperlink{}{flag} set by default and must implement a protected \hyperlink{}{method} that must add tokens to the object \hyperlink{}{index} in order to ensure a unique identifier.

\end{DoxyItemize}

\hyperlink{}{References} represent a list of reference values structured as an array of key/value pairs where the key represents the reference label or name and the value the reference value. Labels must be strings, values can be of any type.

Note that this class does not throw exceptions (hahaha), operations that fail are simply aborted.

This class overloads its \hyperlink{class_c_institute}{ancestor} to implement an institute entity taken from the F\-A\-O W\-I\-E\-W\-S institutes database.

This kind of institutes adds the following properties\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}

\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-O\-F\-F\-S\-E\-T\-\_\-\-U\-R\-L}}\-: This offset represents the institute \hyperlink{}{U\-R\-L}. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-O\-F\-F\-S\-E\-T\-\_\-k\-E\-N\-T\-I\-T\-Y\-\_\-\-I\-N\-S\-T\-\_\-\-F\-A\-O\-\_\-\-L\-A\-T\-L\-A\-T\-I\-T\-U\-D\-E}}\-: This offset represents the institute \hyperlink{}{latitude}, note this is an integer value. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-E\-N\-T\-I\-T\-Y\-\_\-\-I\-N\-S\-T\-\_\-\-F\-A\-O\-\_\-\-L\-O\-N}}\-: This offset represents the institute \hyperlink{}{longitude}, note this is an integer value. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-E\-N\-T\-I\-T\-Y\-\_\-\-I\-N\-S\-T\-\_\-\-F\-A\-O\-\_\-\-A\-L\-T}}\-: This offset represents the institute \hyperlink{}{altitude}, note this is an integer value. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

Unlike its \hyperlink{class_c_institute}{parent}, this class will use the institute \hyperlink{}{code} as-\/is for the object unique \hyperlink{}{identifier}, the index \hyperlink{}{hashing} method will not transform the \hyperlink{}{index} since it is at most 7 characters thus cannot conflict with other \hyperlink{class_c_entity}{entity} identifiers.

Ancestor.

This include file contains the parent class definitions. Local defines.

This include file contains all local definitions. Graph node.

This class implements a graph node.

The class is derived from \hyperlink{class_c_persistent_object}{C\-Persistent\-Object}, of which it inherits the persistence framework, but it differs profoundly in that, although the class is an Array\-Object, the actual array that it manages is the properties array of the node. In other words, when you add, retrieve and delete properties, you are not doing so with the internal array, but with the node's properties array.

The class features a single data member, the \hyperlink{}{node} which contains a Neo4j node reference.

Since the object requires a valid \hyperlink{}{node} to exist at all times, this may either be an empty one, if we wish to create a new node, or a \hyperlink{}{loaded} one, this means that it is not possible to use the inherited interface of instantiating the object with array contents, the container provided to the \hyperlink{}{constructor} must be a Neo4j client.

{\itshape Note that the class will not cast to an array correctly, you must use the \hyperlink{}{get\-Array\-Copy} method to get an array, if you know how to solve this, please do it!}

This include file contains all default token definitions. Local defines.

This include file contains the local class definitions. Institute.

This class overloads its \hyperlink{class_c_contact}{ancestor} to implement an institute contact entity.

Institutes feature specific properties that are added to the inherited ones\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-O\-F\-F\-S\-E\-T\-\_\-\-A\-C\-R\-O\-N\-Y\-M}}\-: This offset represents the institute list of \hyperlink{}{acronyms}. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-O\-F\-F\-S\-E\-T\-\_\-\-U\-R\-L}}\-: This offset represents the institute list of U\-R\-Ls or web pages. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

The object is considered \hyperlink{}{initialised} only if it has its \hyperlink{}{code}, as its \hyperlink{class_c_entity}{ancestor}, its \hyperlink{}{name}, \hyperlink{}{password} and \hyperlink{}{e-\/mail} address.

If the \hyperlink{}{code} has not been explicitly set, \hyperlink{}{before} \hyperlink{}{committing} the object it will be set to the value of the \hyperlink{}{e-\/mail}. Also in that phase, the \hyperlink{}{k\-E\-N\-T\-I\-T\-Y\-\_\-\-U\-S\-E\-R} constant will be set in the user \hyperlink{}{type}.

The \hyperlink{}{e-\/mail} in this class is a scalar property, in other classes it will probably be a list of different e-\/mail types. In this class we want to link a single user with a single e-\/mail, possibly not shared by any other user, that is why we link by default the user \hyperlink{}{code} and \hyperlink{}{e-\/mail}.

The unique identifier of this class is composed by the default \hyperlink{}{index} of thew object, prefixed by the \hyperlink{}{k\-E\-N\-T\-I\-T\-Y\-\_\-\-I\-N\-S\-T} token and the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-O\-K\-E\-N\-\_\-\-C\-L\-A\-S\-S\-\_\-\-S\-E\-P\-A\-R\-A\-T\-O\-R} token, this allows institutes and other types of \hyperlink{class_c_entity}{entities} to share the same \hyperlink{}{code}; this is enforced both in the \hyperlink{}{Hash\-Index} method, to which you only need to pass the user \hyperlink{}{code}, and in the protected \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-\-Prepare\-Commit} method which will place the resulting string in the global \hyperlink{}{identifier}.

It is equivalent to the \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-\_\-\-G\-E\-T\-\_\-\-O\-N\-E} operation, except that instead of using the query provided in the \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-D\-A\-T\-A\-\_\-\-Q\-U\-E\-R\-Y} parameter, it will try to extract an identifier from the object provided in the \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-D\-A\-T\-A\-\_\-\-O\-B\-J\-E\-C\-T} parameter. Remember to \hyperlink{class_c_data_type_a608d6fc184bce537ce83669f729d6008}{serialise} the reference before providing it to the wrapper.

This {\itshape abstract} class implements a common interface shared by all classes in this library.

The library uses the following conventions\-:

{\bfseries Naming standards}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Classes}\-: All class names in this library start with a capital ({\itshape C}), for instance {\itshape C\-Another\-Class}, followed by a name starting with another capital letter. 
\item {\bfseries Public methods}\-: All public method names should begin with a capital letter, for instance {\itshape Another\-Method()}. 
\item {\bfseries Protected and private methods}\-: All protected and private method names should begin with an underscore, for instance {\itshape \-\_\-\-Another\-Method()}. Another case in which names would start with an underscore is with core static methods. 
\item {\bfseries Members}\-: All members should start with lowercase ({\itshape m}), followed by a capital letter. For instance {\itshape m\-Member}. 
\item {\bfseries Static members}\-: All static members should begin with lowercase ({\itshape s}), so a static member could be {\itshape C\-Some\-Class\-::\$s\-Static\-Member}. 
\item {\bfseries Definitions}\-: All definitions should start with a ({\itshape k}) and be followed by a code and ending with an uppercase name, for instance {\itshape k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-D\-O\-M\-A\-I\-N} would be the definition of a domain tag. 
\item {\bfseries Method arguments}\-: All method arguments should start with either {\itshape the}, for parameters holding miscellaneous values, such as {\itshape \$the\-Variable},, or with a lowercase verb, such as {\itshape is}, {\itshape has} or {\itshape do}, for parameters holding a flag value, such as {\itshape is\-Protected}. 
\item {\bfseries Local variables}\-: All local variables should be in {\itshape lowercase}, for instance {\itshape \$local\-\_\-counter}. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

In general, abstract classes implement public interfaces which call a protected implementation. Usually the public methods should not be overridden, while derived classes may implement custom behaviours in the protected interface.

This class implements the following interfaces\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Offsets}\-: In this class there cannot be an offset with a {\itshape N\-U\-L\-L} value, the offset itself should be \hyperlink{}{deleted} in that case. Because of this we also override the inherited behaviour by suppressing notices and warnings when \hyperlink{}{getting} non-\/existant offsets. 
\item {\itshape J\-S\-O\-N encoding}\-: Derived classes will use J\-S\-O\-N for web-\/services, so we provide two static methods to \hyperlink{}{encode} and \hyperlink{}{decode} J\-S\-O\-N strings allowing for exceptions on errors. 
\item {\itshape String formatting}\-: We provide a generalised static method to \hyperlink{}{format} strings which accepts a bitfield parameter that indicates which operation to perform, such as \hyperlink{}{U\-T\-F8} encode, \hyperlink{}{left} and \hyperlink{}{right} trim, \hyperlink{}{N\-U\-L\-L} handling, \hyperlink{}{case} insensitive conversion, \hyperlink{}{U\-R\-L}, \hyperlink{}{H\-T\-M\-L} and \hyperlink{}{H\-E\-X} encoding and \hyperlink{}{hashing}. 
\item {\itshape Time formatting}\-: We provide a generalised static \hyperlink{}{method} to display duration strings.

Ancestor.

This includes the ancestor class definitions. Tokens.

This include file contains all token definitions. Edge index.

This class implements a graph edge node index, it can be used to replicate a Neo4j edge node to a Mongo\-D\-B collection.

Neo4j uses Lucene as its standard indexing tool, in this library we use Mongo\-D\-B as the standard database, so it is a logical choice to use Mongo as the indexing mechanism for Neo4j. Also, by storing nodes in Mongo, by dumping the database contents we also have the graph structure with it.

The class features a single data member, the \hyperlink{}{node} which contains a Neo4j edge node reference. When \hyperlink{}{instantiating} this class you are required to provide a persistent instance of a node.

The contents of the object will be the node properties as will be stored in the Mongo \hyperlink{}{default} collection for edges\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-L\-I\-D}}\-: This offset will hold the edge node I\-D. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-P\-A\-T\-H}}\-: This offset will hold the edge node path, that is, the source node I\-D, the predicate term \hyperlink{}{identifier} and the object node I\-D, all three separated by the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-O\-K\-E\-N\-\_\-\-I\-N\-D\-E\-X\-\_\-\-S\-E\-P\-A\-R\-A\-T\-O\-R} token. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-S\-U\-B\-J\-E\-C\-T}}\-: This offset will hold the subject node information\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-T\-E\-R\-M}}\-: The subject node term \hyperlink{}{identifier}. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-O\-D\-E}}\-: The subject node I\-D. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-P\-R\-E\-D\-I\-C\-A\-T\-E}}\-: This offset will hold the predicate information\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-T\-E\-R\-M}}\-: The predicate term \hyperlink{}{identifier}, which corresponds to the edge node type. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-O\-D\-E}}\-: The edge node I\-D. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-O\-B\-J\-E\-C\-T}}\-: This offset will hold the object node information\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-T\-E\-R\-M}}\-: The object node term \hyperlink{}{identifier}. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-O\-D\-E}}\-: The object node I\-D. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-D\-A\-T\-A}}\-: This offset will hold the edge node properties. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

The class provides a single member accessor method\-: \hyperlink{}{Node}, which can be used to set the referenced edge node.

{\itshape Note that the class will not cast to an array correctly, you must use the \hyperlink{}{get\-Array\-Copy} method to get an array, if you know how to solve this, please do it!}

A data element tagged by an instance of the \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_term}{C\-Ontology\-Term} class will have all its metadata stored in that term, but there are cases in which one term is not enough to describe the full metadata of a data element\-: for instance, a trait may be measured using different methods and workflows, and this data may also be measured in different units. For this reason this class extends the term \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_term_object}{base} class to handle this case.

Instances of this class contain a list of ontology \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_term}{terms} whose elements are related between each other by predicates, which are also \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_term}{terms}, this \hyperlink{}{attribute}

This path or chain of \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_term}{terms} represents the unique identifier of this class instances and the tags with which data elements can be described.

The path root is a \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_term}{term} whose \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_node_abfe1cb2e10bb53cf7d500c9860e5cb7a}{kind} must be \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-T\-R\-A\-I\-T} which represents {\itshape what the data element is and the path leaf is a \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_term}{term} whose \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_node_abfe1cb2e10bb53cf7d500c9860e5cb7a}{kind} must be \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-M\-E\-A\-S\-U\-R\-E} which represents the {\bfseries type} or {\bfseries scale} of the data; all the \hyperlink{class_c_ontology_term}{terms} found between these two describe {\bfseries how} the data was measured or obtained. This path or chain represents the {\itshape descriptors} of data in this library and the container in which these objects are stored represents the data dictionary.}

{\itshape No two objects may exist with the same \hyperlink{}{path}.}

{\itshape All instances of this class are uniquely \hyperlink{}{identified} by a combination of two elements\-:}

{\itshape

{\itshape This class is the ancestor of all persistent objects in this library, it implements the common interfaces and workflow that persistent objects will use to be \hyperlink{}{instantiated}, \hyperlink{}{retrieved} or \hyperlink{}{stored} in object \hyperlink{class_c_container}{containers}.}

{\itshape This class interacts closely with \hyperlink{class_c_container}{C\-Container} derived classes so that concrete classes derived from this one need only to be concerned with their specific functionality, while persistent issues are handled foth by this class and by the concrete classes derived from \hyperlink{class_c_container}{C\-Container}.}

{\itshape The class declares three main persistence operations whose workflow is as follows\-:}

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{Create}}\-: The \hyperlink{}{constructor} can instantiate an object from data, as its \hyperlink{class_c_array_object}{ancestor}, a protected \hyperlink{}{method} may be overloaded by derived classes to implement specific functionality. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{Retrieve}}\-: The \hyperlink{}{constructor} is also used to retrieve objects stored in a \hyperlink{class_c_container}{container}, this operation follows these steps\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{Prepare}}\-: This step is used to check parameters and prepare the resources needed to locate and retrieve the object. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{Find}}\-: In this step the object will be searched for and retrieved from the \hyperlink{class_c_container}{container}. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{Store}}\-: This operation will store the object in a \hyperlink{class_c_container}{container}, the followed steps are\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{Prepare}}\-: This step is used to check parameters and prepare the resources needed to save the object. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{Store}}\-: This operation will perform the actual storage, this step should be delegated to the \hyperlink{class_c_container}{container}. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}}

{\itshape This class implements the default behaviour, in derived classes you should overload these methods if necessary, without changing the public interface.}

{\itshape This class extends its \hyperlink{class_c_status_object}{ancestor} behaviour to record persistence status and accepts only instances derived from \hyperlink{class_c_container}{C\-Container} as containers.}

{\itshape Ancestor.}

{\itshape This include file contains the parent class definitions. Unit objects ancestor.}

{\itshape A unit object is one that has a unique identifier, that is, it can be uniquely identified among a collection of other objects.}

{\itshape Instances derived from this class have a series of additional properties and methods that govern how these can be stored and retrieved from containers.}

{\itshape The class features two read-\/only public methods that return\-:}

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-id()}}\-: The object unique identifier as used by the native persistent container to uniquely identify the object. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-index()}}\-: The full index that uniquely identifies the object, expressed as a string. 
\end{DoxyItemize}}

{\itshape Although both methods seem to return the same information, they are different, in the sense that the \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-index} method should return the property or properties that constitute the object's unique identifier concatenated in a single string. This may be too long to use as an index, so \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-id()} should return the actual value used as the key, which may be the hashed \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-index} value. In other words, \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-index} is the human readable version of \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-id}.}

{\itshape When the object is \hyperlink{}{committed} for the first time, the value of the \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-id} method will be set in the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-L\-I\-D} offset which represents the object I\-D. This offset should never be changed and represents the persistent identifier of the object.}

{\itshape The class implements the \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-\-\_\-to\-String} method to return the value of the object's \hyperlink{}{index} by default.}

{\itshape This object also introduces the concept of object reference, that is, a structure that can be used to refer to other objects. The class implements a series of protected methods that derived classes can use to implement properties that point to other objects\-:}

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-\-Parse\-References}}\-: When adding object references to properties one is also allowed to add the actual instance, at \hyperlink{}{commit} time, these objects must also be committed before committing the object that references them\-: this method will handle this. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{class_c_attribute_a58d5de30d4a6ea29f485a266460a2bdd}{Manage\-Object\-List}}\-: This method can be used as a base for handling properties that consist of object references lists. It handles a list of scalar object reference elements or a list of predicate/object pairs. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{Normalise\-Related\-Object}}\-: This method can be used to normalise parameters that expect object references, these can be overloaded by derived classes to implement a custom framework. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{Normalise\-Related\-Predicate}}\-: This method can be used to normalise parameters that expect predicate object references, these can be overloaded by derived classes to implement a custom framework. 
\end{DoxyItemize}}

{\itshape The above protected interface is not used in this class, but it is made available to derived classes in order to handle objects derived from this class.}

{\itshape Objects derived from this class also hold, by default, their class name in an \hyperlink{}{offset}, this is used to \hyperlink{}{instantiate} objects of thecorrect class when retrieving data from a container.}

{\itshape This class also features a \hyperlink{}{version} which is an integer, incremented each time the object is \hyperlink{}{committed}\-: this is useful to implement a concurrency control mechanism.}

{\itshape Starting from this class we only handle \hyperlink{class_c_container}{C\-Container} derived instances as containers, other container types will not be supported. This is because \hyperlink{class_c_container}{C\-Container} derived instances have an \hyperlink{class_c_data_type_a608d6fc184bce537ce83669f729d6008}{serialise} and \hyperlink{}{unserialise} interface for handling special data types.}

{\itshape The specifics of this are managed by the \hyperlink{class_c_container}{C\-Container} derived classes, so when planning your objects think in advance in what containers you plan to store them.}

{\itshape Finally, this class features a series of static methods;}

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{New\-Object}}\-: This method can be used to instantiate a class from a mixed class data store, it accepts the same parameters as the \hyperlink{}{constructor}, but will return an instance of the correct \hyperlink{}{class}. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{Reference}}\-: This method will convert an instance derived from this class into a standard object reference structure in which it is possible to indicate both the \hyperlink{}{container} and the \hyperlink{}{database}. 
\end{DoxyItemize}}

{\itshape We declare the class abstract because the object must be \hyperlink{}{inited} to be \hyperlink{}{committed} and the \hyperlink{}{index} must be explicitly implemented.}

{\itshape This include file contains the parent class definitions. Related unit objects ancestor.}

{\itshape This class extends its \hyperlink{class_c_persistent_unit_object}{parent} to add two properties\-: a list of related objects and a pointer to a valid object.}

{\itshape This object introduces the concept of object reference, that is, a structure that can be used to refer to other objects. The \hyperlink{}{Relate} method can be used to manage a list of object references in the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-R\-E\-F\-S} offset, this list can take two forms\-: it can be an array of object references, or an array of predicate/object pairs that can constitute a graph.}

{\itshape This class also features a \hyperlink{}{property} that can be \hyperlink{}{used} to refer to a valid object\-: in other words, objects do not get deleted, they simply point to the \hyperlink{}{valid} object, that way one can implement a system that maintains referential integrity.}

{\itshape To supplement the last property, this class implements a static \hyperlink{}{method} that can be used to return the valid object, objects that are obsolete or deleted may \hyperlink{}{point} to the valid object, this method will follow the links until it reaches an object that is valid.}

{\itshape We declare the class abstract because none of the \hyperlink{class_c_persistent_unit_object}{parent} abstract methods are here explicitly implemented.}

{\itshape Ancestor.}

{\itshape This includes the ancestor class definitions. Status object.}

{\itshape This class represents the ancestor of classes that must keep track of states or status.}

{\itshape The status is recorded in a \hyperlink{}{property} that does not belong to the object's array data store. The data member consists of a 4 byte bit field in which the first 31 elements are used to record on/off states.}

{\itshape {\itshape Note\-: we only use the first 31 bits because at this time P\-H\-P does not support 64 bit integers and changing the last bit usually results in inversing the other bits.}}

{\itshape The class manages these states through a protected interface\-:}

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-\-Is\-Inited}}\-: This state indicates that an object has been initialised to a \hyperlink{}{state} that allows it to be operated at least to a minimum extent. Objects that are not in this state may raise \hyperlink{}{exceptions} when required resources cannot be found. By default objects are instantiated with this status {\itshape off}. 
\item {\bfseries \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-\-Is\-Dirty}}\-: This \hyperlink{}{status} is generally set each time a change is made to the object's persistent data. By default objects are instantiated with this status {\itshape off}. This class will set this state by default when \hyperlink{}{setting} or \hyperlink{}{deleting} array store elements.

{\itshape This include file contains the local class definitions. User.}

{\itshape This class overloads its \hyperlink{class_c_entity}{ancestor} to implement a user entity.}

{\itshape Users are entities that are used for authentication purposes, they share the same attributes as their parent \hyperlink{class_c_entity}{class} and add one required element\-:}

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-O\-F\-F\-S\-E\-T\-\_\-\-P\-A\-S\-S\-W\-O\-R\-D}}\-: This offset represents the user access password, it will be used in the authentication process. The class features a member accessor \hyperlink{}{method} to manage this property. 
\end{DoxyItemize}}

{\itshape The object is considered \hyperlink{}{initialised} only if it has its \hyperlink{}{code}, as its \hyperlink{class_c_entity}{ancestor}, its \hyperlink{}{name}, \hyperlink{}{password} and \hyperlink{}{e-\/mail} address.}

{\itshape If the \hyperlink{}{code} has not been explicitly set, \hyperlink{}{before} \hyperlink{}{committing} the object it will be set to the value of the \hyperlink{}{e-\/mail}. Also in that phase, the \hyperlink{}{k\-E\-N\-T\-I\-T\-Y\-\_\-\-U\-S\-E\-R} constant will be set in the user \hyperlink{}{type}.}

{\itshape The \hyperlink{}{e-\/mail} in this class is a scalar property, in other classes it will probably be a list of different e-\/mail types. In this class we want to link a single user with a single e-\/mail, possibly not shared by any other user, that is why we link by default the user \hyperlink{}{code} and \hyperlink{}{e-\/mail}.}

{\itshape {\itshape {\bfseries Note\-: this class enforces the \hyperlink{}{encoded} \hyperlink{}{status} \hyperlink{}{flag}, because the object identifier is a binary string, so always use complex data type instances derived from the \hyperlink{class_c_data_type}{standard} types}}.}

{\itshape The unique identifier of this class is composed by the default \hyperlink{}{index} of the object, prefixed by the \hyperlink{}{k\-E\-N\-T\-I\-T\-Y\-\_\-\-U\-S\-E\-R} token and the \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-O\-K\-E\-N\-\_\-\-C\-L\-A\-S\-S\-\_\-\-S\-E\-P\-A\-R\-A\-T\-O\-R} token, this allows users and other types of \hyperlink{class_c_entity}{entities} to share the same \hyperlink{}{code}; this is enforced both in the \hyperlink{}{Hash\-Index} method, to which you only need to pass the user \hyperlink{}{code}, and in the protected \hyperlink{}{\-\_\-\-Prepare\-Commit} method which will place the resulting string in the global \hyperlink{}{identifier}.}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-F\-O\-R\-M\-A\-T}} (required)\-: The data format of the response, it will be returned as\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-P\-H\-P}}\-: A P\-H\-P-\/serialised string. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-J\-S\-O\-N}}\-: A J\-S\-O\-N-\/serialised string. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-E\-R\-A\-T\-I\-O\-N}} (required)\-: The requested operation, each class will implement specialised handlers, this class only implements the following two operations\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-\_\-\-H\-E\-L\-P}}\-: A {\itshape L\-I\-S\-T-\/\-O\-P} command, this command will return in the \hyperlink{}{response} section the list of supported operations as an array structured as follows\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape index}\-: The index will be the operation code. 
\item {\itshape value}\-: The value will be the operation description. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-\_\-\-P\-I\-N\-G}}\-: A {\itshape P\-I\-N\-G} command, this can be used to check if a service is alive. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}}

{\itshape If both the above parameters are present, the service will return an array constituted by the following three sections\-:}

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-D\-A\-T\-A\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-T\-U\-S}}\-: {\itshape Operation status}. This section is returned by default and will inform on the status of the requested operation. It consists of an array containing the following elements\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-T\-U\-S}}\-: {\itshape Response status}. This element will be returned by default regardless of the operation outcome. This corresponds to the severity of the response and it can take the following values\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-M\-E\-S\-S\-A\-G\-E\-\_\-\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-I\-D\-L\-E}}\-: This is the status of the web-\/service before any operation has been executed, or when the operation was successful; this is the response of a successful \hyperlink{}{ping} request. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-M\-E\-S\-S\-A\-G\-E\-\_\-\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-N\-O\-T\-I\-C\-E}}\-: The operation was successful and a notice message was returned. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-M\-E\-S\-S\-A\-G\-E\-\_\-\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-M\-E\-S\-S\-A\-G\-E}}\-: The operation was successful and a message was returned. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-M\-E\-S\-S\-A\-G\-E\-\_\-\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-W\-A\-R\-N\-I\-N\-G}}\-: The operation was successful but a warning was raised. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-M\-E\-S\-S\-A\-G\-E\-\_\-\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-E\-R\-R\-O\-R}}\-: The operation failed because of an error. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-M\-E\-S\-S\-A\-G\-E\-\_\-\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-F\-A\-T\-A\-L}}\-: The operation failed because of a fatal error, this will generally mean that the web-\/service is not operational. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-M\-E\-S\-S\-A\-G\-E\-\_\-\-T\-Y\-P\-E\-\_\-\-B\-U\-G}}\-: The operation failed because of a bug, the developers should be informed of this kind of errors. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-C\-O\-D\-E}}\-: {\itshape Status code}. This element will be returned by default regardless of the operation outcome. It corresponds to the error code; \hyperlink{}{zero} means no error. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-D\-E\-S\-C\-R\-I\-P\-T\-I\-O\-N}}\-: {\itshape Status message}. The response message from the operation, this element is used to return informative messages or to return error messages when the service fails. It will generally be formatted as an array structured as follows\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-T\-Y\-P\-E}}\-: The data type of the message, it will be a \hyperlink{}{string} in general. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-L\-A\-N\-G\-U\-A\-G\-E}}\-: The language I\-S\-O 639 2 character code in which the message is expressed in. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-D\-A\-T\-A}}\-: The actual message data contents. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-A\-F\-F\-E\-C\-T\-E\-D\-\_\-\-C\-O\-U\-N\-T}}\-: {\itshape Record count}. The total number of elements affected by the operation. This tag will only be used by derived classes returning data elements. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-A\-N\-N\-O\-T\-A\-T\-I\-O\-N}}\-: {\itshape Attachments}. A list of key/value pairs containing information relevant to the operation response. For instance, if a series of parameters are required and were not provided, this could list them. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-D\-A\-T\-A\-\_\-\-R\-E\-Q\-U\-E\-S\-T}}\-: {\itshape Service request}. This section will return the actual request provided to the service, this can be used for debugging purposes and will only occur if the optional \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-T\-\_\-\-L\-O\-G\-\_\-\-R\-E\-Q\-U\-E\-S\-T} parameter has been set to 1. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-D\-A\-T\-A\-\_\-\-T\-I\-M\-I\-N\-G}}\-: {\itshape Timers}. This section holds timing information, it will be returned only if you provide the time of day \mbox{[}{\itshape gettimeofday( T\-R\-U\-E )}\mbox{]} in the \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-R\-E\-Q\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-M\-P} parameter. This section is structured as follows\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-R\-E\-Q\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-M\-P}}\-: Request time stamp, the time in which the request was sent; this is the same value sent by the caller in the \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-R\-E\-Q\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-M\-P} parameter. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-P\-A\-R\-S\-E\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-M\-P}}\-: Parse time stamp, the time in which the service finished parsing the request. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-R\-E\-S\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-M\-P}}\-: Response time stamp, the time in which the response was sent. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-D\-A\-T\-A\-\_\-\-R\-E\-S\-P\-O\-N\-S\-E}}\-: Response, this section will hold the operation response, in this class we only respond to \hyperlink{}{operations} list requests. 
\end{DoxyItemize}}

{\itshape Besides the \hyperlink{}{format} and \hyperlink{}{operation} parameters described in the first section, we have three other optional parameters that can be used to receive specific information sections in the response\-:}

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-T\-\_\-\-L\-O\-G\-\_\-\-R\-E\-Q\-U\-E\-S\-T}}\-: Log the request, if the value of this parameter is 1, the response will contain the received request in the \hyperlink{}{request} section. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-T\-\_\-\-L\-O\-G\-\_\-\-T\-R\-A\-C\-E}}\-: Trace exceptions, if the value of this parameter is 1, in the case of an error that triggered an exception, the error response will also include the call trace. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-R\-E\-Q\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-M\-P}}\-: This parameter should hold the timestamp \mbox{[}{\itshape gettimeofday( T\-R\-U\-E )}\mbox{]} in which the client has sent the request, if provided, the service will return the timing information in the \hyperlink{}{timing} section. 
\end{DoxyItemize}}

{\itshape The parameters are expected either in {\itshape G\-E\-T} or {\itshape P\-O\-S\-T}.}

{\itshape If either the \hyperlink{}{format} or the \hyperlink{}{operation} parameters are omitted from the request, the service will return an empty response; this is to prevent unnecessary traffic.}

{\itshape Instances of this class can be considered server objects, and can be implemented with this simple code snippet\-:}

{\itshape {\ttfamily  \$server = new C\-Wrapper(); \$server-\/$>$Handle\-Request(); }}

{\itshape An example of this class implementation can be found in the \hyperlink{}{Wrapper.\-php} source file.}

{\itshape Server definitions.}

{\itshape This include file contains all definitions of the server object. Wrapper client.}

{\itshape This class represents a web-\/services wrapper client, it facilitates the job of requesting information from servers derived from the \hyperlink{class_c_wrapper}{C\-Wrapper} class.}

{\itshape This class supports the following properties\-:}

{\itshape 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{U\-R\-L}}\-: This element represents the web-\/service U\-R\-L, and it is stored in the \hyperlink{}{k\-O\-F\-F\-S\-E\-T\-\_\-\-U\-R\-L} offset. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{Operation}}\-: This element represents the web-\/service requested operation, it is stored in the \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-E\-R\-A\-T\-I\-O\-N} offset. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{Format}}\-: This element represents the web-\/service parameters and response format, it is stored in the \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-F\-O\-R\-M\-A\-T} offset. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{Stamp}}\-: This element represents a switch to turn on and off timing information from the web service, it is stored in the \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-R\-E\-Q\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-M\-P} offset. 
\item {\itshape Log \hyperlink{}{request}}\-: This element represents a switch to turn on and off logging the request\-: if on, the request will be returned by the web-\/service, it is stored in the \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-T\-\_\-\-L\-O\-G\-\_\-\-R\-E\-Q\-U\-E\-S\-T} offset. 
\item {\itshape Log \hyperlink{}{trace}}\-: This element represents a switch to turn on and off tracing exceptions\-: if on, any exception will also hold a trace, it is stored in the \hyperlink{}{k\-A\-P\-I\-\_\-\-O\-P\-T\-\_\-\-L\-O\-G\-\_\-\-T\-R\-A\-C\-E} offset. 
\end{DoxyItemize}}

{\itshape Objects of this class require at least the \hyperlink{}{U\-R\-L} \hyperlink{}{offset}, \hyperlink{}{operation} \hyperlink{}{offset} and the \hyperlink{}{format} \hyperlink{}{offset} to be set if they expect to have an \hyperlink{}{initialised} \hyperlink{}{status}, which is necessary to send \hyperlink{}{requests} to web-\/services.}
