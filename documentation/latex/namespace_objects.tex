Ancestor.

This include file contains the parent class definitions. Local definitions.

This include file contains all local definitions to this class. Entity.

An entity is a person, institution or legal entity that needs to have a specific identity in the global data schema.

Examples of entities could be a gene bank, a germplasm curator, a farmer that donated an accession, etc. Since entities may take different forms, they can be individuals or organisations.

This class implements the features common to all entity derived classes\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-P\-A\-R\-E\-N\-T}\/}\-: This offset represents the entity parents or affiliations. This is an array of object \hyperlink{}{identifiers} or \hyperlink{class_c_entity}{C\-Entity} derived instances. The class features a member accessor \hyperlink{}{method} to manage this property. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-T\-Y\-P\-E}\/}\-: This offset represents the entity type. The \hyperlink{}{class} offset indicates the class to which the object belongs, this offset should indicate what functions the object has. The data is an array. The class features a member accessor \hyperlink{}{method} to manage this property. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-C\-O\-D\-E}\/}\-: This offset represents the entity code, it should also represent the entity unique identifier. The class features a member accessor \hyperlink{}{method} to manage this property. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-N\-A\-M\-E}\/}\-: This offset represents the entity name. The class features a member accessor \hyperlink{}{method} to manage this property. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-O\-F\-F\-S\-E\-T\-\_\-\-M\-A\-I\-L}\/}\-: This offset represents the entity mailing address. The data is structured as an array in which the elements are structured as follows\-: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-T\-Y\-P\-E}\/}\-: This offset represents the address type, this could be \char`\"{}home\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}office\char`\"{} or this element could be missing for a default address. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-T\-A\-G\-\_\-\-D\-A\-T\-A}\/}\-: This offset represents the actual address, it may be a string containing the whole address, or an \hyperlink{}{object} in which each element of the address has its own property. 
\end{DoxyItemize}The class features a member accessor \hyperlink{}{method} to manage this property. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-O\-F\-F\-S\-E\-T\-\_\-\-E\-M\-A\-I\-L}\/}\-: This offset represents the entity e-\/mail. The class features a member accessor \hyperlink{}{method} to manage this property. 
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-O\-F\-F\-S\-E\-T\-\_\-\-P\-H\-O\-N\-E}\/}\-: This offset represents the entity telephone number. The data is structured as an array in which the elements contain the telephone number. The class features a member accessor \hyperlink{}{method} to manage this property. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

Among the above attributes the \hyperlink{}{code} and the \hyperlink{}{name} are required, this means that the object will not have its \hyperlink{}{inited} \hyperlink{}{status} on, if any of these are not set; which also means that the object will not be allowed to be \hyperlink{}{committed}.

By default, the object's unique \hyperlink{}{identifier} will be set with the current \hyperlink{}{code} contents.

This class also features a static \hyperlink{}{method} that should return the default container name in which to store such objects.

{\itshape \hyperlink{class_c_user}{C\-User}\/} class definition.

This file contains the class definition of {\bfseries \hyperlink{class_c_user}{C\-User}} which represents a class mapping a general purpose user.

Ancestor.

This include file contains the parent class definitions. User ancestor.

This class is the ancestor of user classes in this library, it implements an object that represents a basic user. This object features a minimum set of properties that can be set via \hyperlink{}{offsets}.

Besides the properties handled by its \hyperlink{class_c_entity}{parent}, this class implements the following attributes\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{}{k\-O\-F\-F\-S\-E\-T\-\_\-\-P\-A\-S\-S\-W\-O\-R\-D}\/}\-: This offset represents the user access password, it will be used in the authentication process. The class features a member accessor \hyperlink{}{method} to manage this property. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

By default we add as \hyperlink{}{type} the \hyperlink{}{user} entity type.

\hyperlink{namespace_objects}{Objects} of this class can only be \hyperlink{}{saved} if they have both the \hyperlink{}{password} and \hyperlink{}{e-\/mail} set.
